Introduction to Databases and DBMS
Databases: A database is a structured repository or collection of data that is stored and retrieved electronically for use in applications. Data can be stored, updated, or deleted from a database.

Database Management System (DBMS): The software used to access the database by the user and application is the database management system. Check out these few links describing a DBMS in more detail.
